# URL-Shortener

## Overview
This project is a **URL Shortener** web application built using the **MERN stack** technologies. It allows users to generate short, unique URLs for their long URLs, making it easier to share and manage links. The application includes user authentication and authorization to ensure only authorized users can create and manage their URLs.

## Technologies Used
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing URL mappings and user details.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for handling server-side logic.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment for server-side code execution.
- **EJS**: Templating engine for rendering dynamic views.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: Used for secure authentication and authorization.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their accounts using JWT-based authentication.
- **URL Shortening**: Users can input a long URL and get a shortened version.
- **URL Management**: Users can view, edit, or delete their shortened URLs.
- **Redirection**: Visiting the shortened URL redirects users to the original long URL.
- **Authorization**: Only logged-in users can create and manage their shortened URLs.
